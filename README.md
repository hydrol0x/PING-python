# PING (PYXIS) Analyzer

## Plan

This utility will help analyze the data that we recieve from PYXIS. We will be able to integrate with ROOT and read in data files. Using various analysis methods, we will then calculate important metrics such as beam position. Finally, we plan to add support for a GUI that visualizes the beam and detector, as well as support for non-PYXIS detectors.

## Old
Check `old/` for the old test data generator that we wrote. We are now working on a new version that will be used with PYXIS and other detectors when they are built.
